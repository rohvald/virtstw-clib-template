# Vite React-TS-SB-TW Library Template

A template for build a Vite React TypeScript components library, featuring StoryBook and TailwindCSS.

## Usage

1. Import library stylesheet: `import '@<package_name>/style.css'`
2. Tailwind classes are prefixed with `fvlt-` (you can change this in `tailwind.config.js`)

## Scripts

- `npm run storybook`
- `npm run build`

I don't use the rest of the scripts, `test` is used in github workflow though.


## Attribution

This Vite React-TS-SB-TW Component Library is based on UI Mother's Moon Light Figma Kit.
